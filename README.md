# Emergency-Vehicle-Detection-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of emergency and non-emergency vehicles. It includes data preprocessing, model training with dropout and optimizers to mitigate overfitting, and performance evaluation using accuracy/loss plots and a confusion matrix. Potential applications include smart traffic management and autonomous vehicle systems.
